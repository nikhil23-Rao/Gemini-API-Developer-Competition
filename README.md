# Gemini API Developer Contest

Hi! This is our submission for the Gemini API Developer Competition.

Our web application is a Gemini Powerhouse, and utilizes the API many times to serve high-school students' needs. We used Firebase to enhance user experience through it's various features such as a Google OAuth login, and real time features.

Student Dashboard: Organized space to stay productive. Includes integrations with Desmos.

Question Generator: Create questions on any enrolled class (selected in onboarding) through prompting, in which Gemini will first use validation to ensure the topic requested is related to the class you are choosing to create a set for, or importing an image, in which Gemini will generate problems similar to the ones presented in the image. We support both MCQ and FRQ, and have a variety of customization options for users to tailor the questions to their liking. 

Flashcard Generator: Generate flashcards in three unique ways (prompting, images, or generated curriculum for class) all powered by Gemini. Practice your set in the app, or export to Quizlet with ease.

Study Assist/Tutor: Receive live help on school work and concepts in unique ways through Gemini.

Marketplace: a Gemini-powered algorithmic feed/search to help recommend content for you to study, leading to a great user experience.

Discussion Thread: uses Gemini to help answer clarifying questions in the context of the problem set. Also, others can respond to your comment through Firebase's realtime database.

Preferences: Customize your workspace through themes, color profiles, and more.
